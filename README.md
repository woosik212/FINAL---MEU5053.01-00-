There are two Landsat Images which are,
1) L8_Seoul_20130916.tif (Raster file, Landsat 8 image of seoul on 16th Sep, 2013)
2) 2) L8_Seoul_20200428.tif (Raster file, Landsat 8 image of seoul on 28th April, 2020)

and we are going to use thess two raster files to calssifying the Land cover of Seoul and outskirts of Seoul
