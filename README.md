Final Project - Machine Learning and Programming (MEU5053.01-00)


# Project Title
Detecting the changes of Land cover based on machine learning algorithms using Landsat Satellite Images


# Get Satellite Imagery from the links below (Google Drive)

There are two Landsat Images which are,
1) L8_Seoul_20130916.tif (Raster file, Landsat 8 image of Seoul on 16th Sep, 2013)
2) L8_Seoul_20200428.tif (Raster file, Landsat 8 image of Seoul on 28th April, 2020)

and we are going to use thess two raster files to calssifying the Land cover of Seoul and outskirts of Seoul
* The size of file is pretty big
* Be sure to assign the right path where you download two satellite image raster files (.tif).

# Download Zip file to get the Train and Test data for the further analysis (Github zip code download)
